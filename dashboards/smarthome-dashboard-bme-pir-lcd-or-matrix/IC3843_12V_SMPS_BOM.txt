Hello guys, KD here. Today i have made a very powerful but also very compact 12V 10A smps with the popular UC3843 ic. The output voltage of this power supply is adjustable and you can also modify the output voltage of this smps to any required voltage. I have use ETD34 trabsformer with an air gap of 0.8MM. The air gap is very important !. If you want to use this power supply at high current then use a big heatsink and don't forgot to isolate the mosfet and the diode. The isolation distance between the primary and secondary is 7mm which is very safe 

THANKS FOR WATCHING. HAVE A NICE DAY :)
